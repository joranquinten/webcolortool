WebColorTool is a tool for working with color codes on the web. It converts, displays and orders colors based on a provided collection. The primary aim of the grid is providing a visual reference to a color scheme and make it easy to extract colors in the format that you need (Hex, RGB or HSL).

## Online üï∏

The tool is available as a webapp, hosted on Netlify: [WebColorTool web version](https://webcolortool.netlify.app/)

### Deploy status
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/acd3d19b-2dea-4360-b15c-fe551ca5cc6e/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/webcolortool/deploys)

## MacOS üçè

For Mac users, you can install the tool by downloading the [latest release](https://github.com/joranquinten/webcolortool/releases/latest) and installing it on your local machine. It is a standalone application and doesn't require any interwebs to function. Has been tested on Mojave and Catalina.

## Usage üé®

Paste a `;` separated string of color codes and the app wil render all of the colors to a grid with their `hex`, `rgb` and `hsl` values generated. The values can be copied to the clipboard by clicking on the appropriate line.

## Open Source üíª

WebColorTool was built by me for something that I needed. I figured maybe other developers or designers have similar needs as mine, so I published the software along with the source code. Feel free to make suggestions, improvements or fork your own implementation. If you're interested in that sort of thing, read on!

_This part is for the code monkeys_ üêí

## Installation

The project is built using the Vue CLI, so the following should be familiar (and I'm sure you could find the `npm` counterpart of the commands if that's your taste):

### Project setup

```
yarn
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

For the web version, use the following command:

```
yarn run serve
```

For the electron version, use the following command:
```
electron:serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

For the web version, use the following command:

```
yarn run build
```

For the electron version, use the following command:
```
electron:build
```

‚òùÔ∏è This compiles only for MacOS at the moment.

### Lints and fixes files

```
yarn run lint
```

### Run your unit tests

Optionally add the familiar [Jest flags](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/cli) (<pattern or filename>, `--watch`, `--coverage` etc)

```
yarn run test:unit
```

That's pretty much it. As long as you adhere to Vues own styleguide and best practices, improvements are always welcome. I am aware that the project is that particularly well organized, optimized or covered by tests. It's was a quick way of setting up something that I needed. 

Cheers,

Joran
