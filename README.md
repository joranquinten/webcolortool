# [WebColorTool](https://webcolortool.netlify.com)

WebColorTool is a tool for working with color codes on the web. It converts, displays and orders colors based on a provided collection. The primary aim of the grid is providing a visual reference to a color scheme and make it easy to extract colors in the format that you need (Hex, RGB or HSL).

## Installation

The project is built using the Vue CLI, so the following should be familiar:

### Project setup

```
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
yarn run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
yarn run build
```

### Lints and fixes files

```
yarn run lint
```

### Run your unit tests

Optionally add the familiar [Jest flags](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/cli) (<pattern or filename>, `--watch`, `--coverage` etc)

```
yarn run test:unit
```

## Usage

Paste a `;` separated string of color codes and the app wil render all of the colors to a grid with their `hex`, `rgb` and `hsl` values generated. The values can be copied to the clipboard.
